# Collateral Poker

It is card game for 2 to 4 players. It is build with JAVA.
For now it is not a playable version but working call/raise mechanics which can be 
tested in cmd.

What need to be done is:
  - Computer player decision mechanics
  - Graphic interface
  - Add multiplayer
  - Rewrite game to Android
